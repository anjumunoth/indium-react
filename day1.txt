Why react:
-- trending 
-- project requirement  -- client 
-- lighter and dynamic and easy
-- faster than angular (virtual DOM)
-- 

React

javascript library -- lightweight

Angular -- front end framework
MVC(1.x) MVVM(2.x above)

immutablility
one way flow of data(no two way data binding)
lightweight; install the modules
Virtual DOM 
Unit Testing
Jest testing framework
Server -- axios 


DOM --Document Object Model -- tree structure of html elements:
one root node
parent child relationship

modify the DOM -- costly affair
traverse through the DOM -- modify the DOM -- refresh the page 

Virtual DOM --
Each react component will return the virtual DOM

virtual dom will be mapped to REal DOM -- created

Changes to be made
-- return a new virtual dom with the required changes

2 virtual dom;s
1 VDOM before the changes; 1 VDOM after the changes;

React will find the diff b/w the 2 virtual doms

wherever the differences are there, only in those places , real DOM will be modified


10 elements in virtual dom

2 changes are to be made

-- 10 elements with changes in virtual DOM

diffing algorithm will find the differences -- 2 diff

2 diff will be made in the real dom
2 elements are modified

Angular -- entire page will be refreshed -- 10 elements in REAL dom

React is faster than Angular
React is efficient than Angular



 

 








Java String : immutable 
python : immutable 

once assigned a value, it cannot be changed.

props -- immutable in nature;
